## **FOREX STORIES**

The Forex markets have been in range for the last two years. That means trend-following traders will have nothing profitable to report until prices start to move up or down much. Multiple small losses are common. I am awaiting the next few big moves that will more than cover the losses.

#### _AUDUSD_
Short at 0.7454 with stop at 0.7854.

#### _EURUSD_
Long at 0.1.1127 with stop at 1.0727.

#### _GBPUSD_
No position.

#### _NZDUSD_
Short at 0.7034 with stop at 0.7434.

#### _USDCAD_
Long at 1.3411 with stop at 1.3011.

#### _USDCHF_
Short at 0.9793 with stop at 1.0193.

#### _USDJPY_
Long at 113.74 with stop at 106.74.

## **US STOCK STORIES**

The US stock markets are largely in the uptrend where many folks are smiling away for obvious reasons. So here, I am reporting selected stocks that are in the downtrend.

#### _ALXN_
The downtrend exit is above 119.

#### _BIIB_
The downtrend exit is above 276.07.

#### _ESRX_

#### _Do You Get Emotional When You Try to Work Out 5+8?_

Do the following questions:

1. 5+8
2. 14-5
3. 4×9
4. 56/7

You and I can get the answers in a matter of seconds.

Questions:
– Did you get emotional when you were working out the questions?
– Did you use discretion when you were working out the questions?
– Did you read up a manual when you were working out the questions?
– Did you follow the news when you were working out the questions?
– Did you second-guess when you were working out the questions?
– Did you use multiple indicators when you were working out the questions?

“No” to all the 6 questions?

One more question:
– Did you act like a programmed robot when you were working out the questions?

Yes?

Last question (we promise):
– Why did you act like a programmed robot when you were working out the questions?

Because the 4 questions are all about numbers. You either get it or you don’t.

Right!

When I trade, I do it as if I ame working on 5+8, 14-5, 4×9 or 56/7. With my basic intelligence, I just work out the numbers. No emotions, no discretion, no manual, no news, no second-guessing, no multiple indicators which are all RUBBISH. I just need a plain robotic action.

Read this cheesy poem:

TRADING IS A GAME.
TRADING IS A NUMBERS GAME.
TRADING IS NOT AN EMOTIONAL GAME.
TRADING IS NOT A DISCRETIONARY GAME.
TRADING IS NOT A REFER-TO-MANUAL GAME.
TRADING IS NOT A FOLLOW-THE-NEWS GAME.
TRADING IS NOT A SECOND-GUESSING GAME.
TRADING IS NOT A MULTIPLE-INDICATORS GAME.
TRADING CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS DOING 2+3.
TRADING CAN GET MORE COMPLEX LIKE DOING 546X24.
BUT IN THE END,
TRADING IS STILL A NUMBERS GAME.

Not quite Dr Seuss or Shakespeare, but you get the meaning.
If you can regard trading the same way as doing Mathematics, you will know how to succeed in trading.
